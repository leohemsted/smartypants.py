.. notes on writing changes

  - use reStructuredText as much as possible, code in backticks or code blocks
  - no period in the end of line
  - lower case, base form, e.g. "add" and "remove" not "added" nor "adds"
  - line wrapping at 80 characters, i.e. max line length is 79 characters
  - use symbols, even though they look same in Sphinx doc

    - "*" for modifications, fixes, or a set of grouped changes
    - "+" for additions
    - "-" for removals

    .. note:: need to group each type into block, if without blank lines to
              separate, Sphinx gives warnings.

    Normally, they should be ordered in and separated by blank lines
